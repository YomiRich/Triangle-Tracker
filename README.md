##BDD
-Any number entered should give me a result. It could either be a type of triangle, or not a triangle.
-When I enter two equal numbers, the result should be isosceles triangle.
-When I enter three equal numbers, the result should be equilateral triangle.
-When none of the sides is equal and the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side, the result should be scalene triangle.
-If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, the result is not a triangle.
